## Interviewing Record

**Q:** Excuse me, we are students from ShanghaiTech University, can we have a short interview with you?

**A:** With pleasure!What do you want to know?

**Q:** The outbreak of COVID-19 is unexpected for everyone. How did it affect your life?

**A:** My parents and I knew the epidemic sooner after my mother went home by train. we are all worried about whether she would be infected with the virus. So we check the infection information online to see if there were people carring COVID-19 on the same train. Unfortunately, there is an infected passenger taking the same train.

**Q:** Oh, that's terrible!

**A:** After a discussion, my mother decided to quarantine herself, because the hospital is too dangerous, you know.

**Q:** Indeed. So what do you feel during your mother's self-insulation?

**A:** At first, I was terribly afraid of losing her. So I kept reading all the relevent news and articles to learn more information. After several days, I knew that the situation wasn't that much serious. But it turned out to be a long time not seeing her.

**Q: **Can you tell me more about this feeling?

**A:** Well, in order to reduce the risk that my father and I will be infected too, my mother locked herself at a bedroom for two weeks. We provided her with food and daily supplies by putting everything in front of the door and then we would walk away. Later, she could open the door and got those things quickly. At last, I would usually come back to spay some alcohol, However, we couldn't meet each other, let alone hug her.

**Q:** That's a big issue. Have you though about any possible method?

**A:** We haven't try anything. But I indeed had imagined there was a virus net. You know, like a mosquito net can protect us from bites, the virus net can cut the spread of COVID-19. So that I can at least talk with my mother face to face.

**Q:** Actually it is a good idea. Maybe we can try to make it come true. Thank you for time!
